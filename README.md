# My-Programming-Learning-Journey

My programming journey started a little over three years ago. As many, I had a little of a fall out with this magnificent area. But as I advanced in my college journey, I realized the importance that programming ahs in the biological fields, and as my college journey comes to an end I decided to restart my learning, but since what have been previously learned has not been forgotten (for the most part), I decided to revisit what I did not remember and dive a little bit deeper into what I've already known.
But since I intend to go to the *Bioinformatics* field, my journey will have some *Python* and *Python* related bias.

Thus my journey commences again

## Front-end Journey
- The Base 

I decided to start from the basics, I revisited *HTML* and went to *PUG* as HTMLpreprocessor as it is notonly a more asthetic pleasing syntax, but also easier to code in. I also  decided to dive deeper into the *CSS*, going to *SASS* as my CSS preprocessor of choice, mainly for the same reasons as *PUG*. I then started revisiting *JavaScript*, but I kept it in vanila *JavaScript* due to incompatibility of my original code to any *JavaScript* Preprocessor.
